== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the addon work? =

The addon adds a new page to the set of SLP configuration pages.
The 'User Managed Locations' page presents the Admin with a list of configured users.
The manage locations capability of each individual user can be toggled between Allow and Disallow.
Each allowed user will get access to the Locations configuration page of the SLP plugin.
For the Admin, the Locations configuration page shows an additional column with the
user who is allowed to manage that particular location.
Each individual location can be managed by both the Admin and the allowed user.
The Admin also has the capability to change the value of the store user.

= What are the terms of the license? =

The license is GPL.  You get the code, feel free to modify it as you
wish. I prefer that customers pay because they like what I do and
want to support the effort that brings useful software to market.  Learn more
on the [License Terms page](http://www.storelocatorplus.com/products/general-eula/).
